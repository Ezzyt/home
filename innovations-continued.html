						<!--The Television-->
		<h2>The Television</h2>
			<p class = "Even">Television! It's probably something that you have already experienced
			before. Do you know what it is and it's origin? The television is a small box 
			with enormous amounts of information that changed entertainment and communications
			forever. The invention of the television was the work of many individuals, and 
			therfore cannot be credited to a single person. TV plays an important part of 
			our everyday lives. It rapidly developed during the 19th and the 20th century.
			The first television camera was invented by two men without knowing that they
			both were working on the same invention, as ironically, there was no TV at that
			time. They thought they were each goign to be famous for their ideas, not knowing
			that they both had the exact same idea. These two men were known as; Vladimir Zworykin
			and Philo Taylor. In 1884, a man known as Paul Gottlieb Nipkow created and patented the 
			first television which he called the electromechanical television system. Though
			Color TV was not a new idea since it was thought about by many individuals. However, 
			in 1925 Zworykin was the first that filed a patent for an electronic color television system.
			Over time, television gained political importance as every country started to share
			their political agenda through it. Politicians saw the Tv as a way of self promotion,
			making it even more popular. TV also suddenly became a way of preserving peace and
			order between political parties, organizations and countries.</p>

						<!--Antibiotics-->
		<h2>Antibiotics And Medicine</h2>
			<p class = "Odd">A giant step forward in the field of medicine, antibiotics 
			saved millions of lives by killing and preventing the growth of harmful 
			bacteria. Scientists like Louis Pasteur and Joseph Lister were the first 
			to recognize and attempt to combat bacteria, but it was Alexander Fleming
			who made the first leap in antibiotics when he accidentally discovered the
			bacteria-inhibiting mold known as penicillin in 1928. Antibiotics proved to
			be a major improvement on antiseptics—which ironically killed human cells along with 
			bacteria—and their use spread rapidly throughout the 20th century. Nowhere 
			was their effect more apparent than on the battlefield. While nearly 20 percent
			of soldiers who contracted bacterial pneumonia died in World War I, with 
			antibiotics, mainly Penicillin—that number dropped to only 1 percent during 
			World War II. Antibiotics including penicillin, vancomycin, cephalosporin and
			streptomycin have gone on to fight nearly every known form of infection, 
			including influenza, malaria, meningitis, tuberculosis etc.</p>

						<!--Trading And Bartering System-->
		<h2>Trading And the Bartering System</h2>
			<p class = "Even">From the beggining of dawn man has tried to make things 
			convenient for himself. Due to this habit, people were starting to become
			lazy, and always wanted others to do their work for them free. Eventually
			society got tired of such people, and the bartering system was born. The
			bartering system was a system, where in order to get something, you would
			have to trade something in return. Its basically like saying an apple for
			a tomato. This system was the solution to the laziness problem society used
			to face in history. Due to this system, lazy people were forced to work
			because if they didn't do so, they wouldn't get what they wanted in return.
			The bartering system still exists to this day, just in different forms. For
			example, today if you wanted to make money, you would have to trade your 
			skills and labour in return. The more you work, the more money you make. 
			People evolved from this system, and that is how business was created. People
			got the idea of making others work for them in return for money and then 
			selling the fruit of their hard work to the society around them. This is 
			how people started to make even more money. Nowadays, it is almost impossible
			to live without money, unless ofcourse you have the ability to self sustain!</p>

						<!--The Internet-->
		<h2>The Internet</h2>
			<p class = "Odd">After the computer was invented, scientist had thought of many ideas,
			including connecting all computers to each other. The first prototype of the internet was
			created in the year 1950, however, it was still not revolutionary, a goal which scientists
			wanted to achieve. In the mid 1990's their goal was achieved. Scientists had found the way
			to connect all computers and this revolutionized technology. After that, came the creation
			of the electronic mail, an idea no one had ever thought of before. With this came the 
			ability to call and message at your will. Our technologies have developed so much now with 
			the aid of the internet that we also have the ability to face time, a concept which revelutionized
			technology. In order to locate the ip adress of things such as the electronic mail, came the 
			creation of the world wibe web, also known as "WWW." Tim Burnese is the father of the world wide
			web, a concept which is now used to share information.</p>

						<!--Paper Curency-->
		<h2>Paper Currency</h2>
			<p class = "Even">Throughout much of human history, money mostly took the form of precious 
			metals, such as gold, silver, iron, etc. It even took the form of coins, made by the government
			or the absolute monarchy system, and even raw materials like livestock or vegetables and fruits.
			The inception of paper money and currency ushered in a bold new era. A world in which currency
			could purchase goods and services despite having no intrinsic value. Paper currency was widely
			used in China in the ninth century, however it did not appear in Europe until the late 1600s.
			It was a very important matter spurred on by frequent shortages of coins, which finally made banks
			issue paper notes as a promise against future payments of precious metals and as well as to be used
			as currency. By the late 19th century many nations had begun issuing government-backed legal tender that
			could no longer be converted into gold or silver. The switch to paper money not only bailed
			out struggling governments during times of crisis; like it did for the United States during the
			Civil War, but it also ushered in a new era of international monetary regulation that changed
			the face of global economics. Perhaps even more importantly, paper currency was the vital 
			first step in a new monetary system that led to the birth of credit, debit and visa cards 
			for things such as electronic banking.</p>

						<!--Conclusion-->
		<h2>What Does The Future Bring?</h2>	
			<p class = "Odd">Humans have evolved over the years, and there are everyday 
			examples to prove that fact. Here were some examples of the innovations that I
			think can easily prove that humans have evolved over the years. We are becoming 
			smarter as well as better in everything generation after generation. As we go along,
			there will be many more things to come for the future. What do you think the future
			will bring? Want to know some possible ides that I think may come true in the 
			future? Go check out the next page!</p>
						<!--Summary-->
		<h2 id = "S">Summary</h2>
			<p class = "Even">In conclusion, we have covered ten topics today. They are the top ten innovations 
			that changed human history in my opinion. These are the steam engine, the rail way, the airplane, the 
			light bulb, transistors, the television, medecine, the trade system, the internet, and finally to conclude,
			paper currency. In my opinion, from all these inovations, the innovation of the light bulb was the greatest
			innovation in my opinion, as without it, we would not have a reliable source of the one thing that we need most,
			light. Things that we cannot see are something that I think can harm us as we do not know what we are dealing 
			with. What do you think is the greatest innovation made throught human history?</p>
