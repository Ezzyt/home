		<h1>The Greatest Innovations Throught Human History</h1>
						<!--Introduction-->
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p class = "Even">Throughoout history, humans have progressed
			beyond limits. As an intelligent species, we have evolved so much 
			and made many accomplishments throughout our lifetime. Every human
			ever born will bring a great difference to the future generations.
			With the technology we have today, we have made a great impact on
			everything around us. But it all started small and then kept 
			progressing until today. Here are five of the inventions that 
			changed the lives of humans forever.</p>

						<!-- Steam Engine-->
		<h2>The steam engine.</h2>
			<p class = "Odd">Thomas Savery planned the first practical steam 
			engine in 1698. It was one of the greatest innovations in history
			making him infamous. Later in the year 1781, a man named James Watt 
			patented the steam engine as well as improved it very much. He was the
			one who went on to fuel and start one of the most greatest technological
			leaps in human history during the Industrial Revolution. In later years, 
			the steam engineâ€™s basic principle technology set the stage for greater 
			innovations like internal combustion engines and jet turbines, which was
			the introduction that prompted the rise of cars and aircraft during the 
			20th century. Here is an image of the steam engine.</p>

						<!-- Railways -->
		<h2>The rail way.</h2>
			<p class = "Even">Railway is a mode of transport which can carry a 
			large number of passengers with ease of comfort and/or heavy loads 
			for long and great distances. Modern trains history dates back to around
			200 years ago, which revolutionized the way we travel and the world 
			of transport. With the power of the trains, industries had the power
			to reach to far lands and recieve raw materials in abundance. After the 
			invention of the steam engine, more research was carried out throughout 
			the entire world for a better design that could improve stability, 
			efficiency and weight. The commercial appearance of train networks 
			began in the late 1820s, and the pioneer in that field was inventor 
			George Stephenson, with his design known as the Rocket, the most famous
			early railway locomotive. The Rocket gained great expansions in the lands,
			and soon became very popular. In 1821, he was employed as an engineer for 
			the construction of the Stockton and Darlington railway, which was opened 
			as the first public railway in 1825. The success of Rocket and the opening 
			of the Stockton to Darlington railway line energized railway industry like 
			never before. Here is an image of oldern day railways.</p>

						<!-- Airplane-->
		<h2>The Air plane.</h2>
			<p class = "Odd">On December 17, 1903, Wilbur and Orville Wright (also 
			known as the Wright brothers) achieved something that no man had ever 
			done before. They had engineered the first powered, sustained and controlled
			airplane. While flying machines had been dreamt about in the time since famous
			artist and original inventor of the idea Da Vinci, the Wright Brothers were the
			ones that were able to achieve this idea, and became the biggest successes. 
			Airplanes were just an imagine which they turned into a	reality. Beginning with
			just gliders, the duo laid the foundation for modern aeronautical engineering. 
			Additionally, new businesses boomed such as industrialization of the airplane, 
			along with a number of people being trained to fly planes. The possibility to fly
			over thousands of miles in less time would not have been made possible if the 
			aircraft were not invented, a success that only the Wright brothers were able to
			achieve.</p>

						<!--The Light Bulb-->
		<h2>The Light Bulb</h2>
			<p class = "Even">The energy we use today at home, our office and many more places
			is a literall "bright idea" from more than 150 years ago. Pioneered in the early 19th
			century by Humphry Davy, electric lights developed throughout the 1800s was one of the
			most influential, great inventions of all times. The cause behind this was because society
			had never seen such a convenience before, and everyone wanted it. Edison and Swan were
			the first patenters of the light bulb in 1879 and 1880. In the mid-1980s, new technology
			known as the CFLs hit the market. But the drawbacks such as high cost, size, low light 
			output, and inconsistent performance made them less prominent in the market than the 
			original light bulb. Currently, in our generation, the best source of light known is the 
			LED light. LEDs in comparison offer the best source of energy savings on the market due
			to their efficiency and prices.</p>

						<!--Transistors-->
		<h2>Transistors</h2>
			<p class = "Odd">The transistor is an essential component in almost every modern electronic
			gadget. It is a thin and compact component that performs two main functions. It can either perform
			as an amplifier or a switch. In 1926, Julius Lilienfeld patented a field-effect transistor, but the
			working device was not feasible. It had inconsistencies was very large. In 1947 John Bardeen,
			Walter Brattain, and William Shockley developed the first practical transistor device at Bell
			Laboratories. It won the trio 1956 Nobel Prize in physics. Transistors have become a fundamental
			piece of the circuitry components in countless electronic devices including televisions, cell
			phones, and computers making a remarkable impact on technology. Without the aid of transistors,
			technology would not be as advanced as it is today.</p>
